## A friend of mine is working on a way better project, Plugin Manager (PMA). A CLI tool that installs Powercord, and enables you to download addons and themes directly from it. [Click here to check it out](https://github.com/pluginmanagerr/pma/tree/main)

## [Powercord Setup Wizard](https://gitcdn.link/repo/SlippingGitty/Powercord-Setup-Wizard/main/PowercordSetupWizard.sh)
A simple (unoffical) .sh script that gives it's users a GUI-like menu to install Powercord.

*(Note: Be sure to `chmod` the proper perms for the script to work properly)*

**Features:**

* Downloads Powercord into home directory
* Updates Powercord to latest version
* Can un/inject Powercord into Canary
